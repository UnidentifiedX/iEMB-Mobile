## iEMB Mobile
Mobile client for Hwa Chong Institution's [Integrated e-Message Board (iEMB)](https://iemb.hci.edu.sg).

We've all been in the situation where we want to check our iEMB for an announcement, but can't because you only have your phone.

Or that the iEMB UI is simply ass on a mobile device?

Well, fear not, as I have developed an iEMB app so that you can natively run iEMB on your phone.

### Introduction
✨ Responsive ✨ Fast ✨ Secure ✨ Simple ✨ Open Source ✨ Convenient ✨

iEMB mobile is not only convenient, simple to use and user-friendly, but also blazingly fast! In fact, the only bottleneck to this app's speed is the iEMB's backend! Rather than relying on a 3rd-party API, iEMB mobile directly imitates browser requests to improve speed and performance! 

No more squinting at tiny fonts when using the iEMB website on mobile. And no more ugly UI. We use just *three basic colours*: <span style="color:red">red</span>, white and <span style="color:#1a1a1a; background-color:white">a special shade of black</span>!

All source code is provided in this repository, so feel free to make pull requests and help contribute!

### Download
Unfortunately, iEMB Mobile can currently only support Android, but if I do get a MacBook or plan to port to iOS I will.

I'll release it on the Google Play Store when the time comes, but for now, download it in the [releases tab here](https://github.com/UnidentifiedX/iEMB-Mobile/releases/latest).
